      Manus Bio
    %p
      Manus Bio is company creating new ways to create plant-based ingredients. They needed a new site to communicate the sustainable benefits of their process, shifting associations from science labs to the environment. A fresh update to their logo paved the way for a more modern site. A sleek site redesign with immersive images of nature evokes a "green" atmosphere, while custom drawings illustrate their process. 
      I designed the homepage with wave-like shapes to reflect forms found in nature and create a gentle flow between sections.
