      Show-Score
    %p
      Show-Score is an online community where theater-lovers and professional critics can review, discuss, and discover exciting new theater. In creating a vision and visual identity for Show-Score, I explored the concept of spotlights. Show-Score is a resource that shines a spotlight on new and interesting shows. Each member and critic is shedding his or her own spotlight onto a show to create an overall impression that helps theater-goers decide which shows to check out.

      Furthermore, spotlights are a natural design tool that can be used within branded design. They provide directional lighting to help guide the eye, and they establish an atmosphere, with a timeless quality suited to all types of theater.
